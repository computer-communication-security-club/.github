[Computer&Communication Security Club ](https://ccs-security.club/about.html) is the special interest group for information security at the Mongolian University of Science and Technology. Our mission is to teach students cybersecurity through [events](https://ccs-security.club/news.html) and [competitions](https://ctf.ccs-security.club/). Our club is incredibly diverse, with members from varying disciplines and backgrounds. We believe cybersecurity should be accessible to all, so our content teaches everything from the ground up.

You can find our open-source projects and CTF event challenge sources here on GitHub. We hope you will find these resources as valuable as we did.
